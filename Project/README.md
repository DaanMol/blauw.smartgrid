The map Project exists of several files in which classes and algorithms are rendered. The submap houses and batteries exists of several csv and txt files in which the fixed positions of houses and batteries are determined. The submap graphs contains several images based on the data stored in the submap houses and batteries. The images show the position of houses and batteries in the grid, the designated output from houses localized based in their positions in the grid and the distribution of the amount of energy deposited by all houses. The submap output runs contains all text files outputted during the running of the algorithms. The submap Code contains our algorithms and classes.
