The file algorithms.py contains several algorithms that connect houses and batteries based on different regulations. The algorithms displayed in this file are both constructive and iterative algorithms. The constructive algorithms are Random, Greedy and A*. The iterative algorithms are Hillclimber, Simulated annealing, and K-means. The file batterries.py exists of the class batteries and it's conditions. The file grid.py contains the foundation on which all code is based, as it puts all houses, batteries and gridlines in a tangible entity which can be altered. The file houses.py exists of the class houses and it's conditions. The file actions.py contains the code necessary to render plots of the outcome of our  algorithms.
