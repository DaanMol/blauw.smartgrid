The map Code exists of several files in which classes and algorithms are rendered. The submap houses and batteries exists of several csv and txt files in which the fixed positions of houses and batteries are determined. The submap graphs contains several images based on the data stored in the submap houses and batteries. The images show the position of houses and batteries in the grid, the designated output from houses localized based in their positions in the grid and the distribution of the amount of energy deposited by all houses.  
The file algorithms.py contains several algorithms that connect houses and batteries based on different regulations. The algorithms displayed in this file are both constructive and iterative algorithms. Random is a constructive algorithm, while Hillclimber and Kmeans are constructive algorithms. The file batterries.py exists of the class batteries and it's conditions. The file grid.py contains the foundation on which all code is based, as it puts all houses, batteries and gridlines in a tangible entity which can be altered. The file houses.py exists of the class houses and it's conditions The file upload.py loads the data out of the txt and csv files and puts it in the grid. It also notes the distance of the connections and plots the classes grid, houses and batteries. The file upload_output.txt renders the statespace, upper bound, lower bound and leftover battery capacity of the three districts.
