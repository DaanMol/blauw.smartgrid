The map Code exists of several files in which classes and algorithms are rendered. The submap houses and batteries exists of several csv and txt files in which the fixed positions of houses and batteries are determined. The submap graphs contains several images based on the data stored in the submap houses and batteries. The images show the position of houses and batteries in the grid, the designated output from houses localized based in their positions in the grid and the distribution of the amount of energy deposited by all houses. The submap output runs contains all textfiles outputted during the running of the algorithms.

The file algorithms.py contains several algorithms that connect houses and batteries based on different regulations. The algorithms displayed in this file are both constructive and iterative algorithms. The constructive algorithms are Random, Greedy and A*. The iterative algorithms are Hillclimber, Simulated annealing, and K-means. The file batterries.py exists of the class batteries and it's conditions. The file grid.py contains the foundation on which all code is based, as it puts all houses, batteries and gridlines in a tangible entity which can be altered. The file houses.py exists of the class houses and it's conditions.
